<!-- Introduction Banner and Paragraph -->
<div id="intro">
    <p> Welcome to the Frontlines! This site has been put together for those who are fans of the game Final Fantasy XIV, or those who want to know more about the game and getting started on your incredible journey throughout Eorzea, and lands beyond. </p>
    <p> Eorzea is full of many mysteries and adventure, and they continue to grow and grow every day! Let's explore some of them here!</p>

<!-- Warrior Class Paragraph, Image, and Heading -->
<header class="classhead"> The Warrior | Your Weapon of Choice: Great Axe</header>
    <p> Job Difficulty: Medium </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0W3pGyt.jpg" class="collapsible" id="classpic">
      <p class="cardtext"> The Warrior is the face of Final Fantasy. A Job in the series since Final Fantasy I, the warrior makes its triumphant return in the series, and is still a force to be reckoned with. You cannot become a Warrior from the beginning. The first move you will make will be to become a Marauder, at the Marauder's Guild in Limsa Lominsa. Upon reaching level 30, you can then partake in the first quest to become a true Warrior! </p>
    </div>

<!-- White Mage Class Paragraph, Image, and Heading -->
<header class="classhead"> The White Mage | Your Weapon of Choice: Cane</header>
        <p> Job Difficulty: Easy </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M0yOzqQ.jpg" id="classpic">
      <p class="cardtext">The original classic healer from the very first final fantasy returns! White Mages have always been the beacon of hope for any adventuring team. Starting as Conjurers in Old Gridania, upon reaching level 30, they can transform into the classic healing powerhouse the White Mage! White Mage is focused on bringing heavy heal spells and regeneration tactics to the party, making them a good addition to any group! </p>

<!-- Dragoon Class Paragraph, Image, and Heading -->
<header class="classhead"> Dragoon | Your Weapon of Choice: Lance/Spear</header>
    <p> Job Difficulty: Medium </p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yLRiHpk.jpg" id="classpic">
      <p class="cardtext">Your main moves here will involve jumping high and crashing down on your enemies! Because they offer good support to a party and push high damage as well, the dragoon is a great class for any player! Personally I have played with dragoon since the first time I picked up the game and its a great class for any beginner looking to DPS. The rotation is simple enough for any player to learn and there are not too many cooldown utilizations. You begin as lancer in Old Gridania and upon reaching level 30, you can take your first steps into the life of the legendary Dragoons!</p>
